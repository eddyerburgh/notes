## The 802.11 architecture and protocol stack

802.11 networks can be used in two modes: infrastructure mode and ad-hoc mode {% cite computer-networks -l 299 %}.

**Infrastructure mode** uses an AP (Access Point) that is connected to the network. Clients send and receive packets via the AP. Several APs can be connected to form an extended network {% cite computer-networks -l 299 %}.

</figure>

**Ad-hoc mode** is a collection of computers connected to each other so that they can send frames to each other. There's no AP {% cite computer-networks -l 299 %}.

The 802.11 physical layer corresponds to the OSI physical layer, but the data link layer is split into multiple sublayers.

</figure>

In 802.11 the MAC sublayer determines which channel gets to transmit next. The sublayer above, the LLC (Logical Link Layer), hides the differences between the varying 802.11 versions for the network layer {% cite computer-networks -l 300 %}.

## The 802.11 physical layer

"All 802.11 techniques use short-range radios to transmit signals in either 2.4-GHz or 5-GHz ISM frequency bands". These bands are unlicensed, and so are shared by many other devices such as garage door openers, or microwave ovens. Fewer applications tend to use the 5-GHz band, so 5-GHz can be better for some applications despite shorter range due to higher frequency {% cite computer-networks -l 301 %}.

All 802.11 transmission methods define multiple rates. Different rates can be used depending on the current conditions. If the signal is weak, a low rate is used. If the signal is clear, the highest rate is used. The process of adjustment is called **rate adaption**.

### 802.11b

802.11b is a spread-spectrum method. It supports rates of 1, 2, 5.5, and 11Mb/s {% cite computer-networks -l 301 %}.

802.11b is similar to the [CDMA system](./modulation-and-multiplexing#code-division-multiplexing), except that one spreading code is shared between all users. 802.11b uses a spreading sequence called the **Barker Sequence**. The autocorrelation of the Barker Sequence is low except when sequences are aligned. This allows a receiver to lock onto the start of a transmission. The Barker sequence is "used with BPSK modulation to send 1 bit per 11 chips" {% cite computer-networks -l 302 %}.

Higher rates use CCK (Complementary Code Keying) to construct codes, rather than the Barker Sequence {% cite computer-networks -l 302 %}.

### 802.11a

802.11a was standardized after 802.11b, despite the group being formed first (hence the name). It supports rates up to 54Mb/s in the 5-GHz ISM band {% cite computer-networks -l 302 %}.

802.11a is based on [**OFDM**](./modulation-and-multiplexing#ofdm) (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing).

Bits are sent over 52 subcarriers in parallel. 48 carry data, and 4 are used for synchronization. A symbol lasts 4Î¼s, and sends either 1, 2, 4, or 6 bits. "The bits are coded for error correction with a binary convolutional code first so only 1/2, 2/3, or 3/4 of the bits are not redundant" {% cite computer-networks -l 302 %}.

802.11a can run at different rates using the different combinations . The rates range from 5 to 55Mb/s.

### 802.11g

802.11g uses the [OFDM](./modulation-and-multiplexing#ofdm) modulation methods of 802.11a, but operates in 2.4GHz ISM band {% cite computer-networks -l 302 %}.

It has the same rates as 802.11a, as well as compatibility with 802.11b devices {% cite computer-networks -l 302 %}.

### 802.11n

802.11n was ratified in 2009. The aim of 802.11n was throughput of 100Mb/s after transmission overheads were removed {% cite computer-networks -l 302 %}.

To meet the goal:

- Channels were doubled from 20MHz to 40MHz.
- Frame overhead was reduced by allowing a group of frames to be sent together.
- Up to four streams could be transmitted at a time using four antennas.

{% cite computer-networks -l 303 %}

In 802.11, the stream signals interfere at the receiver, but they can be separated using [MIMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIMO) (Multiple Input Multiple Output) techniques {% cite computer-networks -l 303 %}.

## The MAC sublayer protocol

The 802.11 MAC sublayer is different from the Ethernet MAC sublayer for two reasons:

- Radios are almost always half duplex
- Transmission ranges of different stations might be different

  802.11 uses the **CSMA/CA (CSMA with Collision Avoidance) protocol**. CSMA/CA is similar to ethernet CSMA/CD. It uses channel sensing and exponential backoff after collisions, but instead of entering backoff once a collision has been detected, CSMA/CA uses backoff immediately (unless the sender has not used the channel recently and the channel is idle) {% cite computer-networks -l 303 %}.

The algorithm will backoff for a number of slots, for example 0 to 15 in the case of the of the OFDM physical layer. The station waits until the channel is idle by sensing that there is no signal for a short period of time. It counts down idle slots, pausing when frames are sent. When its counter reaches 0, it sends its frames {% cite computer-networks -l 303 %}.

Acknowledgements "are used to infer collisions because collisions cannot be detected" {% cite computer-networks -l 303 %}.

This way of operating is called **DCF (Distributed Coordination Function)**. in DCF each station is acting independently, without a central control.

The other problem facing 802.11 protocols is transmission ranges differing between stations. It's possible for transmissions in one part of a cell to not be received in another part of the cell, which can make it impossible for a sender to sense a busy channel, resulting in collisions {% cite computer-networks -l 304 %}.

  <figcaption><h4>Figure: The hidden terminal problem {% cite computer-networks -l 305 %}</h4></figcaption>
</figure>

802.11 defines channel sensing to consist of physical and virtual sensing. Physical sensing "checks the medium to see if there is a valid signal" {% cite computer-networks -l 305 %}.

With virtual sensing, each station keeps a record of what channel is in use. It does this with the **NAV (Network Allocation Vector)**. Each frame includes a NAV field that contains information on how long the sequence that the frame is part of will take to complete {% cite computer-networks -l 305 %}.

802.11 is designed to:

- Be reliable.
- Be power-saving.
- Provide quality of service.

The main strategy for reliability is to lower the transmission rate if too many frames are unsuccessful. Lower transmission rates use more robust modulations. If too many frames are lost, a station can lower its rate. If frames are successfully delivered, a station can test a higher rate to see if should upgrade {% cite computer-networks -l 307 %}.

Another strategy for successful transmissions is to send shorter frames. 802.11 allows frames to be split into **fragments**, with their own checksum. The fragment size can be adjusted by the AP. Fragments are numbered and sent using a stop-and-wait protocol {% cite computer-networks -l 307 %}.

802.11 uses **beacon frames**. Beacon frames are broadcast periodically by the AP. The frames advertise
the presence of the AP to clients and carry system parameters, such as the identifier of the AP, the time, how long until the next beacon, and security settings" {% cite computer-networks -l 307 %}.

Clients can set a power-management bit in frames that are sent to the AP to alert it that the client is entering **power-save mode**. In power-save mode, the client rests and the AP buffers traffic intended for it. The client wakes up for every beacon, and checks a traffic map that's sent with the beacon. The traffic map tells the client whether there is buffered traffic. If there is, the client sends a poll to the AP, and the AP sends the buffered traffic {% cite computer-networks -l 307 %}.

802.11 provides quality of service by extending CSMA/CA with defined intervals between frames. Different kinds of frames have different time intervals. The interval between regular data frame is called the **DIFS (DCF InterFrame Spacing)**. Any station can attempt to acquire a channel after the channel has been idle for DIFS {% cite computer-networks -l 308 %}.

The shortest interval is **SIFS (Short InterFrame Spacing)**. SIFS is used to send an ACK, other control frames like RTS, or for sending another fragment (which prevents another station from transmitting during the middle of a frame) {% cite computer-networks -l 308 %}.

Different priorities of traffic are determined with different **AIFS (Arbitration InterFrame Space)** intervals. A short AIF can allow the AP to send higher priority traffic. An AIF that is longer than DIFS means the traffic will be sent after regular traffic {% cite computer-networks -l 308-9 %}.

Another quality of service mechanism is **transmission opportunity**. Previously, CSMA/CA allowed only one frame to be sent at a time. This slowed down stations with significantly faster rates. Transmission opportunities make it so each station has equal airtime, not an equal number of sent frames {% cite computer-networks -l 309 %}.

## 802.11 frame structure

There are three different classes of frames used in the air:

- Data
- Control
- Management

<figure>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/computer-networking/802.11/802.11-data-frame.svg" alt="">
  <figcaption><h4>Figure: Format of the 802.11 data frame {% cite computer-networks -l 310 %}</h4></figcaption>
</figure>

The first part of frame is the _Frame Control_ field, made up of 11 subfields:

- _Protocol Version_: set to `00` for current versions of 802.11.
- _Type_: can be one of data, control, or management, and the _Subtype_ (e.g RTS or CTS). These are set to `10` and `0000` in binary for a normal data field.
- _To DS_ and _From DS_: these bits indicate whether frames are coming or going from a network connected to the AP (the network is called the distribution system).
- _More Fragments_: this bit means that more fragments will follow.
- _Retry_: this bit "marks a retransmission of a frame sent earlier".
- _Power Management_: this bit indicates that the sender is going into power-save mode.
- _More Data_: this bit indicates that the sender has additional frames for the receiver.
- _Protected Frame_: this bit indicates that the frame body has been encrypted for security.
- _Order_: this "bit tells the receiver that the higher layer expects the sequence of frames to arrive strictly in order".

{% cite computer-networks -l 309-10 %}.

The second field in the data frame is the _Duration_ field. This describes how long the frame and its acknowledgements will occupy the channel (measured in microseconds). It's included in all frames, including control frames {% cite computer-networks -l 310 %}.

The addresses to and from an AP follow the standard IEEE 802 format. The _Address 1_ is the receiver, _Address 2_ is the transmitter, _Address 3_ is the address of the endpoint that originally sent the frame via the AP {% cite computer-networks -l 310 %}.

The _Sequence_ 16-bit field numbers frames so that duplicates can be detected. The first 4 bits identify the fragment, the last 12 contain a number that's incremented on each transmission {% cite computer-networks -l 310 %}.

The _Data_ field contains the payload. It can be up to 2312 bytes. The first bytes of the payload are for the LLC layer to identify the higher-layer protocol that the data is a part of {% cite computer-networks -l 310 %}.

The final part of the frame is the _Frame Check Sequence_ field, containing a 32-bit CRC for validating the frame {% cite computer-networks -l 310 %}.

"Management frames have the same format as data frames, plus a format for the data portion that varies with the subtype (e.g. parameters in beacon frames)" {% cite computer-networks -l 310 %}.

Control frames contain _Frame Control_, _Duration_, and _Frame Check Sequence_ fields, but they might only have one address and no _Data_ section.

## Services

802.11 defines a number of services that must be provided by conformant wireless LANs.

Mobile stations use the **association service** to connect to APs. Usually, the service is used just after a station has moved within range of an AP. When the station is within range, it learns the identity and capabilities of the AP through either beacon frames, or by asking the AP directly. The station sends a request to associate with the AP, which the AP can either accept or reject {% cite computer-networks -l 311 %}.

The **reassociation** service is used to let a station change its preferred AP. If correctly used, there should be no data loss between the handover. The station or the AP can also **disassociate**. The station should use this before shutting down {% cite computer-networks -l 311 %}.

Stations should **authenticate** before sending frames via the AP. Authentication is handled differently depending on the security scheme. If the network is open, anyone can use it. Otherwise credentials are required. **WPA2 (WiFi Protected Access 2)** is the recommended approach that implements security defined in the 802.11i standard. With WPA2, the AP communicates with an authentication server that "has a username and password database to determine if the station is allowed to access the network". A password can also be configured (known as a pre-shared key) {% cite computer-networks -l 311 %}.

The **distribution** service determines how to route frames from the AP. If the destination is local, the frames are sent over the air. If they are not, they are forwarded over the wired network. {% cite computer-networks -l 311 %}

The **integration** service handles translation for frames to be sent outside the 802.11 LAN {% cite computer-networks -l 312 %}.

The **data delivery** service lets stations transmit and receive data using the protocols outlined in this section {% cite computer-networks -l 312 %}.

A **privacy service** manages encryption and decryption. The encryption algorithm for WPA2 is based on **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**. The encryption keys are determined during authentication {% cite computer-networks -l 312 %}.

The **QOS traffic scheduling** is used to handle traffic with different priorities. It uses the protocols described in [The MAC sublayer protocol section](#the-mac-sublayer-protocol) {% cite computer-networks -l 312 %}.

"The **transmit power control** service gives stations the information they need to meet regulatory limits on transmit power that vary from region to region" {% cite computer-networks -l 312 %}.

"The **dynamic frequency selection** service give stations the information they need to avoid transmitting on frequencies in the 5-GHz band that are being used for radar in the proximity" {% cite computer-networks -l 312 %}.
