## Introduction

A compiler takes a program as input and produces an executable (e.g., assembly code code or bytecode).

A compiler generally has five phases:

1. Lexical analysis
2. Parsing
3. Semantic analysis (e.g., types and scope rules)
4. Optimization
5. Code generation (translation)

These notes cover the five phases.
