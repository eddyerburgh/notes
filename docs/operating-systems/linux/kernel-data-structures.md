## Linked lists

A linked list is a data structure that stores a variable number of elements, called the nodes of the list. Unlike a static array, the elements in a linked list are added dynamically. This means the size of a linked list doesn't need to be known at compile time.

Because the elements are created dynamically at run time, there's no guarantee that they will be in contiguous memory. Therefore, the elements need to be linked together using pointers. Each element in a linked list contains a pointer to the next element. The pointers are updated as elements are added and removed from the list {% cite lkd -l 85 %}.

### Singly and doubly linked lists

A simple data structure for a linked list might look like this:

```c
/* an element in a linked list */
struct list_element {
    void *data; /* the payload */
    struct list_element *next; /* pointer to the next element */
};
```

  <figcaption><h4>Figure: Singly linked list {% cite lkd -l 86 %}</h4></figcaption>
</figure>

Some linked lists also container a pointer to the previous element. These lists are called doubly linked lists. Linked lists that only have a pointer to the next element are called singly linked lists.

A doubly linked list would look something like this:

```c
/* an element in a linked list */
struct list_element {
    void *data; /* the payload */
    struct list_element *next; /* pointer to the next element */
    struct list_element *prev; /* pointer to the previous element */
};
```

  <figcaption><h4>Figure: Doubly linked list {% cite lkd -l 86 %}</h4></figcaption>
</figure>

### Circular linked lists

Normally the last element in a linked list points to a special value, like `NULL`, to indicate that it's the last element in a list.

In a circular linked list the last element instead points to the first element in the list. Circular linked lists can be both singly linked and doubly linked.

  <figcaption><h4>Figure: Circular doubly linked list {% cite lkd -l 87 %}</h4></figcaption>
</figure>

The kernel linked list is a circular doubly linked list.

### Traversing a linked list

In order to find an element in a linked list, you need to linearly visit each list element, and use the element's pointer to visit the next element.

The first element in a list is often represented by a special pointer called the head. The head gives easy access to the start of the list.

In a doubly linked list you can also traverse the list backwards.

### The Linux kernel implementation

The kernel linked list is different to the typical linked list that includes the list data embedded in the list node structure {% cite lkd -l 85 %}.

Since Linux 2.1 the kernel has used an _intrusive_ linked list. The data structure is simple:

```c
struct list_head {
    struct list_head *next
    struct list_head *prev;
};
```

The `next` pointer points to the next list node, and the `prev` pointer points to the previous element. The list node structure is used by embedding it in larger data structure:

```c
struct fox {
    unsigned long tail_length;
    struct list_head list; /* list of all fox structures */
};
```

`list.next` points to the next list node, and `list.prev` points the previous. You can then use the `container_of` macro to access the containing structure of the list node.

```c
#define container_of(ptr, type, member) ({ \
        const typeof( ((type *)0)->member ) *__mptr = (ptr); \
        (type *)( (char *)__mptr - offsetof(type,member) );})
```

`container_of` can find the parent structure given a pointer to the member, because the offset of a given variable in a structure is fixed by the ABI at compile time {% cite lkd -l 89 %}.

### Defining a linked list

A linked list needs to be initialized before it can be used.

You can create the list at runtime using `INIT_LIST_HEAD`:

```c
struct fox *red_fox;
red_fox = kmalloc(sizeof(*red_fox), GFP_KERNEL);
red_fox->tail_length = 40;
INIT_LIST_HEAD(&red_fox->list);
```

If the list is statically created at compile time you can use `LIST_HEAD_INIT`:

```c
struct fox red_fox = {
    .tail_length = 40,
    .list = LIST_HEAD_INIT(red_fox.list),
};
```

### List heads

List heads act as a canonical pointer to the entire list.

Since each struct contains a `list_head`, we need a special pointer that refers to your linked list, without being a list node itself. This special node is in fact a normal `list_head` {% cite lkd -l 90 %}.

You can create a special head node from a list node with the `LIST_HEAD` macro:

```c
static LIST_HEAD(fox_list);
```

### Manipulating linked lists

The kernel provides a family of functions to manipulate linked lists. They all take pointers to one or more list head structures. The functions are implemented as inline functions and can be found in [include/linux/list.h](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v2.6.39.4/source/include/linux/list.h).

All the helper provided are generic: they don't know what struct contains the list nodes, they just work on the generic list nodes. All functions run in constant time (O(1)).

You can add a node to a linked list with `list_add()`:

```c
list_add(struct list_head *new, struct list_head *head)
```

Because the list is circular and has no concept of first or last, you can pass any element for `head`.

To add a new `fox` node to the `fox_list` you would do:

```c
list_add(&f->list, &fox_list);
```

You can delete a node from a linked list with `list_del()`:

```c
list_del(struct list_head *entry)
```

`list_del()` removes the `entry` node from the list. It doesnâ€™t free any memory belonging to entry, it just removes `entry` from the list it belongs to.

To delete a `fox` node from the list:

```c
list_del(&f->list);
```

`list_del()` just modifies the pointers of the `prev` node and the `next` node. You can see this in the implementation:

```c
static inline void __list_del(struct list_head *prev, struct list_head *next)
{
    next->prev = prev;
    prev->next = next;
}

static inline void list_del(struct list_head *entry)
{
    __list_del(entry->prev, entry->next);
}
```

You can iterate over each item in a linked list using the `list_for_each_entry()` macro. Note that iterating over the list is an $$O(n)$$ operation.

The `list_for_each_entry()` macro takes three parameters: `pos`, `head`, and `member`. On each iteration `pos` is a pointer to the next list entry.

This is what it would look like iterating over each `fox` in a `fox` list:

```c
struct fox *f;

list_for_each_entry(f, &fox_list, list) {
    /* on each iteration, f points to the next fox structure */
}
```

You can see a real example in `inotify_watch()`, the kernel's file notification system:

```c
static struct inotify_watch *inode_find_handle(struct inode *inode,
					       struct inotify_handle *ih)
{
	struct inotify_watch *watch;

	list_for_each_entry(watch, &inode->inotify_watches, i_list) {
		if (watch->ih == ih)
			return watch;
	}

	return NULL;
}
```

## Queues

Queues are a first-in-first-out data structure. Data is removed from the queue in the order it's added, with the oldest data removed first.

Queues are useful for implementing the producer-consumer pattern. A producer can push data to a queue and a consumer can then remove data from the queue in order to do something with it {% cite lkd -l 96 %}.

<figure>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/operating-systems/linux/kernel-data-structures/queue.svg" alt="">
  <figcaption><h4>Figure: A queue {% cite lkd -l 96 %}</h4></figcaption>
</figure>

## Kfifo

The Linux queue implementation is called kfifo. It's implemented in [kernel/kfifo.c](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v2.6.39.4/source/kernel/kfifo.c).

Kfifo has two operations: enqueue (named `in`) and dequeue (named `out`). The kfifo object maintains an `in` offset and an `out` offset into the queue. The `in` offset is the position where the next enqueue will add data to, and the `out` offset is the position where the dequeue will remove data from. The `out` offset will always be less than or equal to the `in` offset {% cite lkd -l 97 %}.

The enqueue operation copies data into the queue starting at the `in` offset. After the data is added, the `in` offset is increased by the amount that was enqueued. The dequeue operation copies data from the queue into a buffer. After the dequeue operation, the `out` offset is incremented by the number of items removed {% cite lkd -l 97 %}.

A queue must be defined and initialized. You can do this either statically or dynamically. The most common way is dynamically with `kfifo_alloc()`:

```c
int kfifo_alloc(struct kfifo *fifo, unsigned int size, gfp_t gfp_mask);
```

`kfifo_alloc()` creates and initializes a queue of `size` bytes, where `size` is a power of 2. The `gfp_mask` is discussed later in [the memory management section](/linux/kernel-data-structures). On success `kfifo_alloc()` returns 0, on error it returns a negative code {% cite lkd -l 97 %}.

For example:

```c
struct kfifo fifo;
int ret;

ret = kfifo_alloc(&kfifo, PAGE_SIZE, GFP_KERNEL);

if(ret) {
    return ret;
}

/* fifo now represents a PAGE_SIZE sized queue */
```

You can also allocate your own buffer and create a queue using `kfifo_init()`:

```c
void kfifo_init(struct kfifo *fifo, void *buffer, unsigned int size);
```

You can statically declare a kfifo with `DECLARE_KFIFO` macro:

```c
DECLARE_KFIFO(name, size);
INIT_KFIFO(name);
```

Enqueuing data is done with rhe `kfifo_in()` function:

```c
unsigned int kfifo_in(struct kfifo *fifo, const void *from, unsigned int len);
```

This copies `len` bytes starting at `from` into the queue. The function only copies as many bytes as are free in the queue. The return value is the number of bytes that were successfully copied {% cite lkd -l 98 %}.

You can remove data from a queue with `kfifo_out()`:

```c
unsigned int kfifo_out(struct kfifo *fifo, void *to, unsigned int len);
```

`kfifo_out()` copies up to `len` bytes from the queue to the `to` buffer and returns the number of bytes copied. If the buffer has less than `len` bytes then only that amount is copied.

Once dequeued, data is no longer accessible from the queue. If you want to access data from the queue without removing it, you can the `kfifo_out_peek()` function:

```c
unsigned int kfifo_out_peek(struct kfifo *fifo, void *to, unsigned int len, unsigned offset);
```

`kfifo_is_empty()` and `kfifo_is_full()` return nonzero if the queue is empty or full respectively.

## Maps

"A map, also known as an associative array, is a collection of unique keys, where each key is associated with a specific value" {% cite lkd -l 100 %}.

Maps support at least three operations:

1. Add
2. Remove
3. Value

The kernel provides a map data structure called idr. idr is used for mapping user space UIDs, like POSIX timer IDs, to their associated data structures {% cite lkd -l 100 %}.

You can define an idr by either statically or dynamically allocating an `idr` struct, then cal `idr_init()`:

```c
struct idr id_huh;
idr_init(&id_huh);
```

The next step is to allocate a new UID. First you do this by telling the idr that you want a new UID (which lets it resize the underlying tree if needed). Then you make the request for the UID {% cite lkd -l 101 %}.

The reason for this two-step process is so that the initial call, which can result in additional memory allocation, can run without requiring a lock.

The function to resize the backing tree is `idr_pre_get()`:

```c
int idr_pre_get(struct idr *idp, gfp_t gfp_mask);
```

Unlike almost every other kernel function, `idr_pre_get()` returns 1 on success and 0 on error {% cite lkd -l 101 %}.

The second function to call to get the UID is `idr_get_new()`:

```c
int idr_get_new(struct idr *idp, void *ptr, int *id);
```

`idr_get_new()` associates the pointer `ptr` with the new UID.

You can see a full example of how these are used:

```c
int id;

do {
    if(!idr_pre_get(&id_huh, GFP_KERNEL))
        return -ENOSPC;
    ret = idr_get_new(&idr_huh, ptr, &id);
} while (ret == -EAGAIN);
```

You can look up a value by passing the UID to `idr_find`:

```c
void *idr_find(struct idr *idp, int id);
```

## Red-black trees

Red-black trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree. The red-black tree is Linux's primary binary tree data structure {% cite lkd -l 105 %}.

Red-black trees have a color attribute which is either red or black. They remain semi-balanced by enforcing the following rules:

1. All nodes are either red or black.
2. Leaf nodes are black.
3. Leaf nodes don't contain data.
4. All non-leaf nodes have two children.
5. If a node is red, both of its children are black.
6. The path from a node to one of its leaves contains the same number of black nodes as the shortest path to any of its other leaves.

{% cite lkd -l 105 %}

These properties ensure that the deepest leaf has a depth no more than double the depth of the shallowest leaf. Maintaining the properties during insertion and deletion will keep the tree semi-balanced {% cite lkd -l 105 %}.

The Linux implementation of red-black trees is rbtree, defined in \<lib/rbtree.h\>.

The root of an rbtree is represented by the `rb_root` struct. To create an rbtree you allocate a new `rb_root` and initialize it to `RB_ROOT`:

```c
struct rb_root root = RB_ROOT;
```

rbtree doesn't provide search or insert routines: users of rbtree must define their own. The reason for not including these is that generic programming is very difficult in C, so the kernel developers decided the most efficient approach was for each user to implement them manually using provided rbtree helper functions {% cite lkd -l 105-6 %}.

You can see this by looking at an example. The following `rb_search_page_cache()` function implements a search of Linux's page cache for a chunk of a file (represented as an inode and offset pair). The function searches the `inode` rbtree for a matching offset:

```c
static inline struct page * rb_search_page_cache(struct inode * inode,
						 unsigned long offset)
{
	struct rb_node * n = inode->i_rb_page_cache.rb_node;
	struct page * page;

	while (n)
	{
		page = rb_entry(n, struct page, rb_page_cache);

		if (offset < page->offset)
			n = n->rb_left;
		else if (offset > page->offset)
			n = n->rb_right;
		else
			return page;
	}
	return NULL;
}
```

Insert is more complicated because it needs to both search and insert:

```c
static inline struct page * __rb_insert_page_cache(struct inode * inode,
						   unsigned long offset,
						   struct rb_node * node)
{
	struct rb_node ** p = &inode->i_rb_page_cache.rb_node;
	struct rb_node * parent = NULL;
	struct page * page;

	while (*p)
	{
		parent = *p;
		page = rb_entry(parent, struct page, rb_page_cache);

		if (offset < page->offset)
			p = &(*p)->rb_left;
		else if (offset > page->offset)
			p = &(*p)->rb_right;
		else
			return page;
	}

	rb_link_node(node, parent, p);

	return NULL;
}
```
