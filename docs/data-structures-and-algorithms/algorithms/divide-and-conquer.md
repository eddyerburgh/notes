## Introduction

Divide-and-conquer algorithms involve three steps:

1. **Divide** the problem into smaller subproblems.
2. **Conquer** the subproblems by solving them recursively.
3. **Combine** the solutions to the subproblems into the solution for the original problem.

When a subproblem is large enough to be solved recursively, it's called the **recursive case** {% cite clrs -l 65 %}.

When a subproblem becomes small enough that the algorithm no longer recurses (the recursion "bottoms out"), it is called the **base case** {% cite clrs -l 65 %}.

Merge sort is an example of a divide-and-conquer algorithm.
