# Algorithms
{:.no_toc}

An algorithm is a procedure, designed to accomplish a specific task, that takes input and produces an output.

## Introduction

An algorithm should solve a general, well-specified problem. A specification for an algorithm should include the complete set of instances it will operate on, as well as the algorithm's output after running on each of these instances {% cite algorithm-design-manual -l 3 %}.

Algorithms are commonly expressed either in English, as pseudocode, or in a programming language {% cite algorithm-design-manual -l 12 %}.

A good algorithm is:

- Correct
- Efficient
- Easy to implement

It's not always possible to meet these goals {% cite algorithm-design-manual -l 4 %}.

## Reasoning about correctness

The most important property of an algorithm is that it's correct.

One way to demonstrate the correctness of an algorithm is a mathematical proof.

A mathematical proof consists of four parts:

1. A statement of what you're trying to achieve.
2. A set of assumptions you take to be true.
3. A chain of reasoning that takes you from the assumptions to the statement you are attempting to prove.
4. A little square (âˆŽ) or QED to denote the end of the proof.

### Problems and properties

In order to demonstrate correctness, your problem must be well-specified.

Problem specifications have two parts:

1. The set of allowed input instances.
2. The required properties of the algorithm output.

{% cite algorithm-design-manual -l 12 %}

You should avoid asking ill-defined questions. Asking "what is the best path?" is ill-defined: what does _best_ mean? You should be more specific, for example: "which is the _fastest_ path to take?" {% cite algorithm-design-manual -l 13 %}.

### Demonstrating incorrectness

You can prove an algorithm incorrect by providing an input that produces the incorrect output. These are called **counter-examples** {% cite algorithm-design-manual -l 13 %}.

Good counter-examples are verifiable and simple {% cite algorithm-design-manual -l 13 %}.

### Induction and recursion

Failure to prove an algorithm as incorrect does not make it correct. **Mathematical induction** is a common method to prove the correctness of an algorithm.

The way to prove a predicate $$P$$ through induction is to:

- Prove the case $$P(0)$$.
- Assume that $$P(k)$$ is true.
- Prove $$P(k+1)$$.

_Note: see this [video teaching proof by induction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wblW_M_HVQ8) for further explanation._

### Sigma notation

Summations are common in algorithm analysis.

Sigma notation is a way of expressing summation formulas. For example, the sum of 1 to $$n$$ in sigma notation is:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} i$$

_Note: see this [video explaining sigma notation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jwXThH6fg4) for further explanation._

## Modelling the problem

Modelling is the process of formulating your application in terms of well-defined, well-understood problems. Modelling can eliminate the need to create your own algorithm, since you can rephrase your problem to use a pre-written algorithm {% cite algorithm-design-manual -l 19 %}.

Most problems are real-world problems. For example, you might need to create a system to route traffic. Algorithms don't work on real-world objects, they work abstractions, like a graph. In order to write effective algorithms you must learn how to describe your problems in terms of abstract structures {% cite algorithm-design-manual -l 19 %}.

In order to model a problem, you should have a solid understanding of the [data structures](/data-structures-and-algorithms/data-structures) available to you.
