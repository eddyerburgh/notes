## Data structures

A data structures is a representation of data with a collection of associated operations {% cite open-data-structures -l 5 %}.

Data structures are implementations of abstract data types {% cite open-data-structures -l 4 %}.

## Algorithms

An algorithm is a procedure that takes input and produces output to accomplish a specific task {% cite algorithm-design-manual -l 3 %}.

An algorithm should solve a general, well-specified problem. A specification for an algorithm should include the complete set of instances it will operate on, and the algorithms output after running on one of these instances {% cite algorithm-design-manual -l 3 %}.

A good algorithm is:

- Correct
- Efficient
- Easy to implement

It's often not possible to achieve all three aims.
